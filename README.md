# Kmeans

## Algorithm definition:

> [Kmeans algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group.](https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-algorithm-applications-evaluation-methods-and-drawbacks-aa03e644b48a)

## Description:

The python notebook in this repository aims to:
* Generate two-dimensional random data points.
* Implement the kmeans algorithm.
* Visualize the behavior of the algorithm.

## ToDo:
1. On each plot, show the line that represents the centroid moviment.
